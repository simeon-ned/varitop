Roadmap
=======
No versioning for now

- ☐ Variational Integration
    - ☑ DEL
    - ☐ DELM
    - ☑ Constrained Dynamics
    - ☑ Forced Dynamics*

            See `issue <https://github.com/simeon-ned/varitop/issues/1>`_
    - ☑ URDF Support
    
            For now using existing wrapper is enough (e.g. DARLi)
- ☐ Trajectory optimization 
        
        Basically wrap cs.Opti for now
- ☐ Linearization Based Control
- ☐ Parametric Integrators
        - ☐ Custom URDF Parser

                Having other parsers is not reliable and not flexible enough.
