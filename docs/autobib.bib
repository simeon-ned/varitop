  abstract = {Direct collocation methods are powerful tools to solve trajectory optimization problems in robotics. While their resulting trajectories tend to be dynamically accurate, they may also present large kinematic errors in the case of constrained mechanical systems, i.e., those whose state coordinates are subject to holonomic or nonholonomic constraints, like loop-closure or rolling-contact constraints. These constraints confine the robot trajectories to an implicitly-defined manifold, which complicates the computation of accurate solutions. Discretization errors inherent to the transcription of the problem easily make the trajectories drift away from this manifold, which results in physically inconsistent motions that are difficult to track with a controller. This paper reviews existing methods to deal with this problem and proposes new ones to overcome their limitations. Current approaches either disregard the kinematic constraints (which leads to drift accumulation) or modify the system dynamics to keep the trajectory close to the manifold (which adds artificial forces or energy dissipation to the system). The methods we propose, in contrast, achieve full drift elimination on the discrete trajectory, or even along the continuous one, without artificial modifications of the system dynamics. We illustrate and compare the methods using various examples of different complexity.},

  abstract = {Multibody simulation with frictional contact has been a challenging subject of research for the past thirty years. Rigid-body assumptions are commonly used to approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead to challenging-to-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other hand, robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact, combined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding NCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff dynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially during slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit integration for these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search (TALS), which greatly improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations performed by implicit integrators. We find that TALS works best with semi-implicit integration, but that the explicit treatment of normal compliance can be problematic. To address this, we develop a Transition-Aware Modified Semi-Implicit (TAMSI) integrator that has similar computational cost to semi-implicit methods but implicitly couples compliant contact forces, leading to a more robust method. We evaluate the robustness, accuracy and performance of TAMSI and demonstrate our approach alongside relevant sim-to-real manipulation tasks.},

Two different methods to solve the discretized normal cone inclusions are compared: the projected over-relaxed Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration. The methods are evaluated for an electrically-driven quadrupedal robot in terms of robustness, accuracy, speed and ease of use. Furthermore, the dependence of the simulation speed on the choice of the generalized coordinates is examined. The proposed technique is implemented in C++ and compared to a fast and simple approach based on compliant contact models. In conclusion, the introduced method with hard contacts is very beneficial for the simulation of legged robots.},

To overcome this issue, we extend the modelling tool `RobCoGen' to be compatible with Automatic Differentiation. Additionally, we propose how to automatically obtain the derivatives and generate highly efficient source code. We highlight the flexibility and performance of the approach in two application examples. First, we show a Trajectory Optimization example for the quadrupedal robot HyQ, which employs auto-differentiation on the dynamics including a contact model. Second, we present a hardware experiment in which a 6 DoF robotic arm avoids a randomly moving obstacle in a go-to task by fast, dynamic replanning.},

We provide an interior-point method for efficient evaluation of constrained dynamics and utilize implicit differentiation to compute smooth gradients of this representation. We demonstrate the framework by modeling systems from locomotion, aerospace, and manipulation domains including: acrobot with joint limits, cart-pole subject to Coulomb friction, Raibert hopper, rocket landing with thrust limits, and planar-push task with optimization-based dynamics and then optimize trajectories using iterative LQR.},

Furthermore, it denotes that the damping energy loss is proportional to the square of the impacting velocity, instead of to its cube, as can be deduced from Goldsmith's work. A damping term {$\lambda$}xnx{\textperiodcentered} is here introduced; for a sphere impacting a plate Hertz gives n = 3/2. The Kelvin-Voigt model is shown to be approximated as a special case deducible from this law, and applicable when impacts are absent. Physical experiments have confirmed this postulate.},

As in the standard geometric integration setting, we target long-term structure preservation. We additionally, however, also consider invariant preservation over persistent, simultaneous and/or frequent boundary interactions. Appropriately formulating geometric methods to include such conditions has long-remained challenging due to the inherent nonsmoothness they impose. To resolve these issues we thus focus both on symplectic-momentum preserving behavior and the preservation of additional structures, unique to the inequality constrained setting. Leveraging discrete variational techniques, we construct a family of geometric numerical integration methods that not only obtain the usual desirable properties of momentum preservation, approximate energy conservation and equality constraint preservation, but also enforce multiple simultaneous inequality constraints, obtain smooth unilateral motion along constraint boundaries and allow for both nonsmooth and smooth boundary approach and exit trajectories. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the behavior of these methods on difficult test examples where both smooth and nonsmooth active constraint modes persist with high frequency.},

To this end we use a virtual constraints method that transforms robot's dynamics to a lowdimensional zero manifold; we also use a nonlinear optimization algorithms to find virtual constraints parameters that minimize robot's cost of transportation. We analyzed the effect of the degree of Bezier polynomials that approximate the virtual constraints and continuity of the torques on the cost of transportation. Based on numerical results we found that it is sufficient to consider polynomials with degrees between five and six, as further increase in the degree of polynomial results in increased computation time while it does not guarantee reduction of the cost of transportation. Moreover, it was shown that introduction of torque continuity constraints does not lead to significant increase of the objective function and makes the gait more implementable on a real robot. We propose a two step procedure for finding minimum of the considered optimization problem with objective function in the form of cost of transportation and with high number of constraints. During the first step we solve a feasibility problem: remove cost function (set it to zero) and search for feasible solution in the parameter space. During the second step we introduce the objective function and use the solution found in the first step as initial guess. For the first step we put forward an algorithm for finding initial guess that considerably reduced optimization time of the first step (down to 3{\textendash}4 seconds) compared to random initialization. Comparison of the objective function of the solutions found during the first and second steps showed that on average during the second step objective function was reduced twofold, even though overall computation time increased significantly.},

  abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using these dynamics formulations as constraints in direct trajectory optimization algorithms, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly higher accuracy. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid-body systems, including an underactuated biped and a quadruped. In addition, we use this second-order method to plan locomotion trajectories for a complex quadrupedal microrobot. The planned trajectories are evaluated on the physical platform and result in a number of performance improvements.},

  abstract = {Variational integrators are a class of discretizations for mechanical systems which are derived by discretizing Hamilton's principle of stationary action. They are applicable to both ordinary and partial differential equations, and to both conservative and forced problems. In the absence of forcing they conserve (multi-)symplectic structures, momenta arising from symmetries, and energy up to a bounded error. In this thesis the basic theory of discrete variational mechanics for ordinary differential equations is developed in depth, and is used as the basis for constructing variational integrators and analyzing their numerical properties. This is then taken as the starting point for the development of a new class of asynchronous time stepping methods for solid mechanics, known as Asynchronous Variational Integrators (AVIs). These explicit methods time step different elements in a finite element mesh with fully independent and decoupled time steps, allowing the simulation to proceed locally at the fastest rate allowed by local stability restrictions. Numerical examples of AVIs are provided, demonstrating the excellent properties they posess by virtue of their variational derivation.},

  abstract = {Online planning and execution of acrobatic maneuvers pose significant challenges in legged locomotion. Their underlying combinatorial nature, along with the current hardware's limitations constitute the main obstacles in unlocking the true potential of legged-robots. This letter tries to expose the intricacies of these optimal control problems in a tangible way, directly applicable to the creation of more efficient online trajectory optimisation frameworks. By analysing the fundamental principles that shape the behaviour of the system, the dynamics themselves can be exploited to surpass its hardware limitations. More specifically, a trajectory optimisation formulation is proposed that exploits the system's high-order nonlinearities, such as the nonholonomy of the angular momentum, and phase-space symmetries in order to produce feasible high-acceleration maneuvers. By leveraging the full-centroidal dynamics of the quadruped ANYmal C and directly optimising its footholds and contact forces, the framework is capable of producing efficient motion plans with low computational overhead. The feasibility of the produced trajectories is ensured by taking into account the configuration-dependent inertial properties of the robot during the planning process, while its robustness is increased by supplying the full analytic derivatives \& hessians to the solver. Finally, a significant portion of the discussion is centred around the deployment of the proposed framework on the ANYmal C platform, while its true capabilities are demonstrated through real-world experiments, with the successful execution of high-acceleration motion scenarios like the squat-jump.},

There are diverse alternatives for the implementation of direct transcription. In this study we analyze the effects of such alternatives when solving a robotics problem. Different parameters such as integration scheme, number of discretization nodes, initialization strategies and complexity of the problem are evaluated. We measure the performance of the methods in terms of computational time, accuracy and quality of the solution. Additionally, we compare two optimization methodologies frequently used to solve the transcribed problem, namely Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior Point Method (IPM). As a benchmark, we solve different motion tasks on an underactuated and non-minimal-phase ball-balancing robot with a 10 dimensional state space and 3 dimensional input space. Additionally, we validate the results on a simulated 3D quadrotor. Finally, as a verification of using direct transcription methods for trajectory optimization on real robots, we present hardware experiments on a motion task including path constraints and actuation limits.},

  abstract = {Biological flying, gliding, and falling creatures are capable of extraordinary forms of inertial maneuvering: free-space maneuvering based on fine control of their multibody dynamics, as typified by the self-righting reflexes of cats. However, designing inertial maneuvering capability into biomimetic robots, such as biomimetic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is challenging. Accurately simulating this maneuvering requires numerical integrators that can ensure both singularity-free integration, and momentum and energy conservation, in a strongly coupled system {\textendash} properties unavailable in existing conventional integrators. In this work, we develop a pair of novel quaternion variational integrators (QVIs) showing these properties, and demonstrate their capability for simulating inertial maneuvering in a biomimetic UAV showing complex multibody-dynamics coupling. Being quaternion-valued, these QVIs are innately singularity-free; and being variational, they can show excellent energy and momentum conservation properties. We explore the effect of variational integration order (left-rectangle vs. midpoint) on the conservation properties of integrator, and conclude that, in complex coupled systems in which canonical momenta may be time-varying, the midpoint integrator is required. The resulting midpoint QVI is well-suited to the analysis of inertial maneuvering in a biomimetic UAV {\textendash} a feature that we demonstrate in simulation {\textendash} and of other complex dynamical systems.},

They have rarely been compared in terms of solution and speed. Through five examples of predictive simulations solved using five transcription methods and 100 initial guesses in the Bioptim software, we showed that not a single method outperformed systematically better. All methods converged to almost the same solution (cost, states, and controls) in all but one OCP, with several local minima being found in the latter. Nevertheless, DC based on fourth-order Legendre polynomials provided overall better results, especially in terms of dynamic consistency compared to DMS based on a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, expressing the rigid-body constraints using inverse dynamics was usually faster than forward dynamics. DC with dynamics constraints based on inverse dynamics converged to better and less variable solutions. Consequently, we recommend starting with this transcription to solve OCPs but keep testing other methods.},
